this is made to make you suffer least when coding an irc bot. it does so
because python is simple. i am a firm believer in that python -itself- is a
decent user interface (no need for ini config formats, fancy interactive cli,
or -even worse- graphical user interface).

this script is very minimalist and allows you to easily script out your fancy
irc bot in no time. just search albot.py for '# bot stuff goes here' and start
writing your bot things, then stop when you see '# bot stuff end'
