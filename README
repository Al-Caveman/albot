this is made to make you suffer least when coding an irc bot. it does so
because python is simple. i am a firm believer in that python -itself- is a
decent user interface (no need for ini config formats, fancy interactive cli,
or -even worse- graphical user interface).

this script is very minimalist and allows you to easily script out your fancy
irc bot in no time. just search albot.py for '# bot stuff start here' and start
writing your bot things, then stop when you see '# bot stuff end here'.

once done, you run it by `python albot.py`. that's it; isn't simplicity
beautiful?

examples of using albot.py for implementing specific features (e.g. karma) are
included. these are named albot***.py where *** are numbers.
